## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by our Code of Conduct. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to [contact@justdiego.com](mailto:contact@justdiego.com).

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally
3. Set up the development environment
4. Create a branch for your changes
5. Make your changes
6. Test your changes
7. Submit a pull request

## Development Setup

CriForge is a monorepo built with Turborepo and pnpm. Follow these steps to set up your development environment:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.0.0 or higher
- pnpm 8.0.0 or higher
- Git

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   git clone https://github.com/dewstouh/criforge.com.git
   cd criforge.com
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration

## Making Changes

### Branch Naming Convention

Use descriptive branch names that follow this pattern:
- `feature/description-of-feature`
- `fix/description-of-fix`
- `docs/description-of-docs-change`
- `refactor/description-of-refactor`

### Commit Message Convention

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: A code change that improves performance
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

**Examples:**
```
feat(auth): add social login support
fix(ui): resolve button hover state issue
docs(readme): update installation instructions
```

## Submitting Changes

### Before Submitting

1. **Test your changes:**
   ```bash
   pnpm test
   pnpm build
   ```

2. **Lint your code:**
   ```bash
   pnpm lint
   ```

3. **Format your code:**
   ```bash
   pnpm format
   ```

4. **Update documentation if needed**

### Creating a Pull Request

## Style Guidelines

### Code Style

- We use TypeScript for all code
- Follow the existing code style and patterns
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### File Organization

- Use the established folder structure
- Place files in appropriate directories
- Use PascalCase for components
- Use camelCase for functions and variables
- Use kebab-case for file names

### React/Next.js Guidelines

- Prefer server components when possible
- Use "use client" directive only when necessary
- Follow the route group organization pattern
- Use private folders (`_components`, `_hooks`, `_lib`) for route-specific code
- Implement proper error boundaries
